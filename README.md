## Choosing the right sample size for A/B testing
#### This markdown shows the basics of sample size estimation. In this example I show how I helped a company determine the correct sample size to test their hypothesis. The company was interested in determining whether removing a cohort of less desirable SKU's from a group of stores would decrease total profitability in those stores. To do this I used a technique called 'Power Analysis'.

#### Performing power analysis and sample size estimation is an important aspect of setting up an experiment, because without these calculations, sample size may be too high or too low. If sample size is too low, the experiment will lack the precision to provide reliable answers to the questions it is investigating. If sample size is too large, time and resources will be wasted, often for minimal gain. 

#### Power is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is false i.e. not committing a type 2 error. Therefore, we need to define what "false" means to us in the context of our problem. In this example, the null hypothesis should be a one-sided test that profitability in the test groups is lower than profitability in the control groups. Therefore, "false" in this example would be the opposite, that profitability is higher in the test groups that have less SKU's.

#### I was able to find a power analysis package in R that allows us to solve for the optimal sample size based on significance level, power, and detectable difference. Below I have outlined the steps used to determine these 3 parts of the equation.
1. Define the Null Hypothesis:
- H0: Sales in the test groups and less than the control groups
- H1: Sales in the test groups are higher than the control groups
This is a one-sided hypothesis, since we are only testing if the sales increased.

2. Determining Power and Significance Level
- Type 1 Error (False Positive): Rejecting the null hypothesis when is it actually true 
- Type 2 Error (False Negative): Failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.      
The probability of committing a Type 1 error is called the significance level.    
The probability of committing a Type 2 error is called the power.

- A typical requirement for the power is 80%. In other words, we will tolerate a 20% chance of a type 2 error (1 - power). The typical requirement for the significance level is 5%.

3. Determining what a proper detectable difference should be
For this problem, the detectable difference is the difference in profitablity between test and control stores that would be considered "significant". We cannot solve for the sample size without first specifying the level of impact we want to be able to detect with our test. The key is to define what "pay off" means for this study, which depends on what would be considered a success as well as the cost of running the study. Since I didn't have exact cost estimates that it would take to run this study I asked for a range and used this in my analysis. Using a range also allowed us to see exactly how the minimum sample size relates with a change in detectable differences. 

Below I will walk through the steps described with actual data:

First, I want to do a cursery glance at the data to make sure it is structured correctly and looks reasonable.                                   
1. I am mainly concerned with the Gross Margin and Sales columns. It appears that there is a least one row with zero sales. I will need to get rid of these.  
2. I don't see any null values. This is great.

Next I take a look at how sales vary over the course of the year. The company that I am consulting for want to run their A/B test in the 4th quarter of the year. It looks like the mean and variance of these months are fairly stable.

```r
ggplot(data=sales_raw)+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=factor(Fiscal.Month),y=Gross.Margin..))
```

![](Sample_Size_Markdown_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

```r
sales_raw <- sales_raw[sales_raw$Sales..>100,]
```

In order to run the power analysis I need 4 pieces of information:       
1. Standard Deviation - Below I find the standard deviation of the 3 months in the last quarter of the year.       
2. Power - I am going to use 80%.           
3. Significance Level - I am going to use 5%.           
4. Detectable Difference - I am going to use each multiple of 50 from $500 to $15,000.              

```r
sales_stats<-sales_raw%>%
  group_by(factor(Fiscal.Month))%>%
  summarise(std_dev = sd(Gross.Margin..))
mean(sales_stats[sales_stats$`factor(Fiscal.Month)`%in%c(10,11,12),]$std_dev)
```

```
## [1] 4807.233
```


This code builds out a data frame that has two columns:  
1. The Detectable Differences that I want to iterate the power.t.test function over.   
2. The results of the power.t.test function i.e. the sample size required to detect with 80% power for each Detectable Difference level. 

```r
sd1 <-  4800 # std dev of sales
b <- 0.8 # power 
a <- 0.05 # significance level
dd <- seq(from = 500, to = 15000, by = 50) # detectable differences
result <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = length(dd), ncol = 2))
names(result) <- c("DD", "ni")
for (i in 1:length(dd)) {
  result[i, "DD"] <- dd[i]
  number <- power.t.test(n=NULL, delta = dd[i], sd=sd1, sig.level=a, power=b,
                         alternative = 'one.sided')  
  result[i, "ni"] <-number$n
}
```

This plot shows the results of the power.t.test for each level of detectable difference. The higher we choose to set the detectable difference, the less observations we need in the sample. Therefore, I need to set up another meeting with this company to determine how much money it would cost to implement this test. This would determine our threshold for detectable diffence.

```r
ggplot(data = result, aes(x = DD, y = ni)) +
  geom_line() + ylab("Sample Size Needed") + xlab("Detectable difference in $") + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma, breaks = seq(0,15000,2500), limits = c(0,15000)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma,breaks = seq(0,1000,50), limits = c(0,500))
```
